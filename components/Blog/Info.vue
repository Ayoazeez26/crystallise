          The features of supported living vary depending on the individual’s needs and preferences, but there are a few commonalities. First, supported living arrangements are typically individualized to meet the specific needs of the person receiving services. 
        </p>

    </div>
    <p class="mt-6">
      This means that services and supports are not one-size-fits-all, but rather are tailored to the individual’s unique needs. Second, supported living arrangements are typically person-centered, meaning that the individual receiving services has control over his or her own life and choices. Finally, supported living arrangements promote integration into the community. This means that individuals have opportunities to interact with people who do not have disabilities and to participate in activities that are part of everyday community life.
